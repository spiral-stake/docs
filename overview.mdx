Spiral Stake is a non-custodial leveraged looping protocol designed exclusively for maximizing stablecoin yields. By locking in fixed yields from Principal Tokens (PTs) of staked stablecoins and flash leveraging them at conservative loan-to-value ratios, the protocol delivers amplified returns without compromising security. \
\
Building on Pendle's PT infrastructure, which established the fixed yield foundation - Spiral Stake optimizes borrowing costs across Morpho lending pools to enable stable, predictable leveraged yields that function like high-yield bonds with DeFi upside potential.
