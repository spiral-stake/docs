Spiral Stake operates on a transparent, performance-aligned fee structure designed to align protocol incentives with user success.

## Performance Fee Structure

**10% Performance Fee on Profits**

The protocol charges a single performance fee of 10% calculated exclusively on realized profits when positions are closed. This fee structure ensures the protocol only benefits when users generate positive returns from their leveraged positions.

**Fee Calculation:**

- Fee applies only to profits above the initial deposit amount
- No fees charged on principal or if positions close at a loss
- Fee calculated in the loan token (typically USDC) for transparency
- Automatic deduction during position closure process

**Example:** You deposit \$10,000 and close your position for \$13,000 total value. The \$3,000 profit incurs a \$300 fee (10%), leaving you with \$12,700 net returns.

## No Hidden Costs

**Zero Management Fees:** No ongoing fees or subscription costs while positions remain open. You only pay when the protocol delivers profits.

**No Deposit/Withdrawal Fees:** Standard gas costs for blockchain transactions apply, but the protocol doesn't charge additional fees for opening or closing positions.

**Transparent Gas Optimization:** Flash loan mechanisms reduce total transaction costs by condensing multiple operations into single transactions, saving users gas fees compared to manual leverage loops.
