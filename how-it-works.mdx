Spiral Stake amplifies your stablecoin yields through our FlashLeverage mechanism that bypasses traditional iterative looping for maximum gas efficiency. When you deposit funds, the protocol uses flash loans to instantly create your entire leveraged position in a single transaction, giving you the same exposure as multiple manual loops without the complexity or high costs.

Your deposit gets converted into PT collateral that earns fixed yield until maturity. Instead of borrowing, buying more PT, then repeating this process multiple times, our FlashLeverage system borrows the full amount needed upfront via flash loan, swaps it all to PT collateral, then uses your amplified PT position to secure the borrowed funds—all atomically in one transaction.

The protocol manages position isolation through individual proxy contracts while built-in safety mechanisms like liquidation buffer and safe LTV to maintain stability. When your PT matures, closing your position automatically repays all borrowed amounts and delivers your amplified yields—creating a seamless experience where your stablecoins work harder with full transparency.
