Browse available stablecoin markets and compare their yields to find the best opportunity. Each market shows the expected return, what backs the yield (like staked USDC or DAI), and when the PT expires. Higher yields typically come with different risk profiles, so review what's generating the returns before choosing.

Select your leverage level using the slider to amplify your returns. Conservative leverage (4-5x) offers steady gains with lower risk, while higher leverage multiplies both potential returns and risks. The interface shows your liquidation price and safety buffer to help you decide what's comfortable.

Check the PT maturity date to ensure it matches your timeline. Holding positions until maturity typically delivers the best results since you capture the full fixed yield without worrying about market fluctuations.

Make your deposit in two ways: if you already hold the specific PT, use the one-click leverage feature to instantly create your position. If you have USDC instead, deposit it directly and the protocol automatically converts it to the PT before applying leverage.

Hold your position until the PT matures to realize maximum yields. The protocol handles all the complexity behind the scenes while you earn leveraged returns on your stablecoin deposit. Early exits are possible but may reduce your overall returns due to market conditions and fees.
