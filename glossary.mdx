**Flash Loan** - A loan that must be borrowed and repaid within the same transaction, enabling capital-efficient operations without requiring upfront collateral.

**FlashLeverage** - Spiral Stake's mechanism that uses flash loans to create leveraged positions in a single transaction instead of multiple manual steps.

**Leverage** - Using borrowed capital to increase investment exposure. 3x leverage means controlling \$3,000 worth of assets with \$1,000 of your own money.

**Liquidation** - Forced closure of a leveraged position when collateral value falls below required thresholds, typically resulting in losses.

**Loan-to-Value (LTV)** - The ratio of borrowed amount to collateral value as a percentage. Higher LTV means more leverage but increased liquidation risk.

**Morpho** - A lending protocol that provides competitive borrowing rates by optimizing across different DeFi lending pools.

**Pendle** - A DeFi protocol that separates yield-bearing tokens into Principal Tokens (PT) and Yield Tokens, enabling fixed yield strategies.

**Principal Token (PT)** - A token representing the principal amount of a yield-bearing asset with fixed returns until maturity.

**Proxy Contract** - Individual smart contracts created for each user to isolate their positions from other users' activities.

**Slippage** - The difference between expected and actual execution prices during token swaps due to market movement or liquidity constraints.
